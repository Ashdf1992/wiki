# Seize Operation Master Roles

``` Powershell
Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -Identity "Enter the Name of a DC here" -OperationMasterRole SchemaMaster, DomainNamingMaster, PDCEmulator, RIDMaster, InfrastructureMaster -Force

> This command will allow you to seize the Master Roles, in the event that a DC has been tombstoned and the roles are still on the Tombstoned DC. Note the -force flag.

> Use the above command with caution, and only use it if you are unable to move the roles. Seizing the roles should be a last resort.
