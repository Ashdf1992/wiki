```Powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -RemotePort 443
```

## Get the Owning Process for a specific Local Port
```Powershell
$localport = Read-Host "Enter the Local Port Number you wish to get the owning process for: "
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort $localport -State Listen | select Local*,Remote*,State,@{Name="Process ID";Expression={(Get-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess).Id}},@{Name="Process";Expression={(Get-Process -Id $_.OwningProcess).ProcessName}}
```
