# RDP Brute Force Check
## This wiki will highlight how to check for failed RDP logon attempts to your Windows Server


> The following scripts should be run from within Powershell ISE
{.is-info}

<br>

# Tabs {.tabset}
## Version 1 Entire List

> This version will simply provide you the number of failed login attempts over the past 24 hours.
{.is-info}

Load up Powershell ISE and then paste the below 2 commands
```Powershell ISE
$failLogs = Get-EventLog -LogName Security -InstanceId 4625 -After ((Get-Date).AddDays(-1)) | Select-Object TimeGenerated, Index, InstanceId, @{n='Username';e={$_.ReplacementStrings[5]}}
$failLogs.count
```
## Version 2 IPs

> This version will show the IPs that have failed to log in more than 5 times within the past 24 hours.
{.is-info}


Load up Powershell ISE and run the first command
```Powershell ISE
$badRDPlogons = Get-EventLog -LogName Security -After ((Get-Date).AddDays(-1)) -InstanceId 4625 | Select-Object @{n='IpAddress';e={$_.ReplacementStrings[-2]} }
```
Then run the next 2 commands
```Powershell ISE
$getip = $badRDPlogons | group-object -property IpAddress | where {$_.Count -gt 5} | Select -ExpandProperty Name
$getip
```
## Version 3 AutoBan
> This version will automatically ban the IP Addresses that have failed to login using RDP, in the last 24 hours.
{.is-info}

The first step only needs to be run once, and the IP Address 1.1.1.1 is just a template to create the rule.

Load up Powershell ISE and within the Powershell Section run the following
```Powershell ISE
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "RDP_Brute_Force_Guard" –RemoteAddress 1.1.1.1 -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP –LocalPort 3389 -Action Block
```

Then get a list of IPs that have failed to login 5 times within the past 24 hours, using the following commands within Powershell ISE:
```Powershell ISE
$failLogs = Get-EventLog -LogName Security -After ((Get-Date).AddDays(-1)) -InstanceId 4625 | Select-Object @{n='IpAddress';e={$_.ReplacementStrings[-2]} }
$failLogs2 = $failLogs | group-object -property IpAddress | where {$_.Count -gt 5} | Select -Property Name

```

Then we want to get a list of current IPs within the IP Block Rule, and add the new list of IPs to the rule, this can be done by running the following 

```Powershell ISE
$current_ips = (Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "RDP_Brute_Force_Guard" | Get-NetFirewallAddressFilter ).RemoteAddress
foreach ($ip in $failLogs)
{
$current_ips += $ip.name
}
```

The next step is to apply the new IPs to the ruleset within Windows Firewall.
```Powershell ISE
Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "RDP_Brute_Force_Guard" -RemoteAddress $current_ips
```

> The above can be added as a task that is triggered when the event 4625 is triggered in event viewer. Which will automatically Ban IP Addresses.
